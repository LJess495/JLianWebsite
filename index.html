      <iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RcGyVTAoXEU?si=58JvSpM8pwEAQ62k"></iframe>
      <p> While stress has been made into a public health enemy, new research suggests that stress may only be bad for
        you if you believe that to be the case. Psychologist Kelly McGonigal urges us to see stress as a positive, and
        introduces us to an unsung mechanism for stress reduction: reaching out to others.</p>

    <p>The world consists of over 8.1 billion people. <a href="https://www.singlecare.com/blog/news/stress-statistics/"
        target="_blank">About one-third of people around the world reported feeling stressed, worried, and/or angry in
        2019.</a> Even without doing math, you can imagine how many people are going through hardship and stress in
      their lives. From time to time, it is always important to take a step back and debrief our life journey. How am I
      doing so far? How do I feel? What do I want? Caring for our mental health is a key step in our life. As we
      consciously work in our external environment, we need time to think about what we truly want on the inside.
      Someone who can truly understand what we want. And that is why EmBuddy started. Customize EmBuddy your way because
      it is a reflection of you. Who you truly are. Without the stress, the work, the things you don‚Äôt want to think
      about. Let EmBuddy find your true self and help you understand what you really want and how to get there. EmBuddy
      yourself.
